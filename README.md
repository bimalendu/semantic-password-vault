# 🔐 Semantic Password Vault

A secure, offline Streamlit application that allows you to semantically search through your exported browser passwords by website, username, or related context.

> ❗ Disclaimer: This tool is intended for personal use only. It does not store or transmit any data — everything runs locally on your machine. Please handle your exported password files with care.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload password CSVs exported from Chrome, Edge, or Firefox
- 🔎 Perform semantic search (not just keyword match)
- 📂 Load more results incrementally
- ⚡ Powered by [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) for fast and meaningful search
- 🛡️ 100% offline and secure

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo (or save the file)

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-password-vault.git
   cd semantic-password-vault
````

2. Install dependencies

   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

```uv
   uv init
```

   Install packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas sentence-transformers
   ```
   
   ```uv
   uv add streamlit pandas sentence-transformers

## 📝 Usage

1. Export your passwords from your browser:

   * Chrome / Edge:
     Go to `chrome://settings/passwords` → ⋮ → `Export Passwords` → Save as `.csv`

   * Firefox:
     Firefox does not export passwords natively. You can use an extension or third-party tool to export to `.csv`.

2. Run the app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run password_vault.py
   ```

   ```uv
   uv run -- streamlit run password_vault.py
   ```

3. Upload the `.csv` file using the interface and start searching semantically!

## 🙋 FAQ

### Can this app automatically pull passwords from my browser?

No. This app is designed to avoid accessing system-level password managers or secure storage. You must export your data manually for safety and legal reasons.

### Is my data safe?

Yes. The app never stores or sends your data. It runs entirely in your local Python environment.
